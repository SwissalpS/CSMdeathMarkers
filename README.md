# CSM Death Markers
Minetest Client Side Mod that shows waypoints to where player has died.

The waypoints change colour and fade over time and are stored over sessions per player and server.

If the bones are punched, the waypoint is cleared. It is also cleared if the player stands in the bone position.
Useful when other player has removed bones already, they didn't spawn at all or the items were removed without punching the node.
